# WP6 - Virtual folder - test environment
A vagrant pool to configure VM environment with private West-life Virtual Research Environment. 
Use this for test/production environment, for development go https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/west-life-wp6

## Introduction
West-Life is a H2020 Virtual Research Environment project that will provide the application level services specific to uses cases in structural biology. 
Data management work package WP6 build on existing infrastructure for storing and accessing data. It provides application level service usable for structural biology use cases and follows structural biology data lifecycle (Report ...).
The WP6 is distributed as a vagrant package. Configuration files and scripts which initiates self deployment, installation and configuration of prototype virtual machine.
# Installation
Prerequisites:

 1. Vagrant - tool for automation of virtual machine deployment. Download and install vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com/
 2. Virtualbox - VM stack. Download and install virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Download [ZIP](https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/wp6-vm/archive/master.zip) or clone https://github.com/h2020-westlife-eu/wp6-vm.git into some [wp6-vm directory]

(Optionally), if you are behind proxy, download and install proxyconf plugin and set environment variables

    export http_proxy=http://user:password@host:port
    export https_proxy=https://user:password@host:port
    export no_proxy=localhost
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
    
(Optionally), if you have used west-life VM before, update the boxes cached in local machines
    vagrant box update    

Open command-line (e.g. cmd, cygwin or terminal)
     
    cd [wp6-vm directory]
    vagrant up    

This will start CernVM customization and boots to Scientific Linux 7.2 and configures related WP. Depending on network speed it will take several to several tens of minutes - downloading 200 MB of data.

## Usage
The new virtual machine can be accessed by SSH (by default the 2222 port is forwarded to VM)

    vagrant ssh

or via GUI in virtualbox (username/password: vagrant/vagrant)

Or via web browser (port 8080 is by default forwarded to VM, check VagrantFile or vagrant log)

    http://localhost:8080/
    
Files of the current working directory of host are mounted into /home/vagrant/work/local
Repositories allowing WEBDAV interface (B2DROP) are mounted into /home/vagrant/work/b2drop     

##Current state of prototype implementation
After self deployment and installation the virtual machine provides 3 basic services:

 1. Web application at http://localhost:8080
	 - Optional connection to b2drop repository, directory browsing
 2. WebDAV protocol to the shared data at http://localhost:8080/webdav/
 
## Cleaning
After testing you may, stop (halt) or delete/clean (destroy) all VM related files

   vagrant halt
   vagrant destroy
